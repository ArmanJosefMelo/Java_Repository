<h1>Lab Activity 1</h1>
            <p>This activity utilizes the Scanner utility in Java to ask for the user's First Name, Last Name, Age, Hours Worked,<br>
            and Hourly Wages. When it is done, it concatenates the First Name and Last Name inputs into their Full Name, while<br>
            multiplying their Hourly Wage to the Hours Worked to create their Daily Salary. Finally, it prints out the Full Name,<br>
            Age, and their Daily Wage</p>

<br>
<br>
            
<h1>Lab Activity 2</h1>
            <p>This activity is a continuation of the previous activity, it now adds Weekly, Monthly, Yearly, and Net Salary as well<br>
            their remaining years until retirement. In order, Daily Salary is multiplied by 5 days to get the Weekly Salary, then<br>
            it is multiplied by 4 weeks to get the Monthly Salary, then it is multiplied by 12 months to get the Yearly Salary, finally,<br>
            Net Salary is calculated according to government-related factors, whether beneficial or tax related. Retirement Age is calculated<br>
            by subtracting the government-official age for retirement to the user's age input. All of this are printed accordingly with the<br>
            others.</p>

<h1>Lab Activity 3</h1>
            <p>This activity is a continuation of the previous activity. This activity adds conditional statements, program termination<br>
            with termination message, and slightly more complex calculation for the Net Salary, Role Code is also added for the switchcase<br>
            statement. The program is terminated when the user is below the age of 18, above the age of 65, and has invalid inputs for Hours<br>
            Worked(More than 24 hours or less than 0), all of which utilizes conditional statements. Role Code Scanner is added to the set<br>
            of Scanners which asks the user for numbers 1-4, each signifying a hierachial role, the Position Manager, Supervisor, Staff,<br>
            Intern, and Undefined when the user gives an invalid input.</p>
